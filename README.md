## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of natural language processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by implementing a topic classification model to categorize Stack Overflow questions into three categories: Spark, Machine Learning, or Security using PyTorch.

### Pipeline

### Dataset and Models

- Dataset: Stack Overflow data containing questions and their associated categories (Spark, Machine Learning, or Security)
- Models: RNN-based model (LSTM and GRU) as the primary approach
